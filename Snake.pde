//I tried to create a new ellipse for the snake to eat. I tried to make a new variable A,B. it didnt work so i copied the ellipse code and it worked. 
//Now i need to figure out how to move the circle, I changed the grid size in the ellipse code and it moved it
// The rectangle only goes through the circle but doesnt eat it
// I added a boundry to one side of the code to make it start over when it hits the wall.
//I decreased the number between moves to make it increase speed each time
